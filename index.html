					<div class="project-summary">
						<p>While many solutions already exist to encourage adoption of shelter dogs over purchasing ones from breeders or pet stores, these solutions tend to emphasize a dog’s <em>physical characteristics</em> over other, less visible traits. In many adoption apps and websites, a dog's photographs are presented first and relevant information second.</p>
						<p>This focus on dogs' appearances has ultimately resulted in the overrepresentation of less “popular” breeds within shelters, further perpetuating the stigma of these particular breeds as being “un-adoptable.”</p>
						<p>I wanted to create a solution that was both interactive and personalizable to help individuals who may be seeking to adopt a dog from a local shelter. This application aims to empower users to make informed decisions when selecting adoption candidates that are better suited to their own lifestyles.</p>

					<h3 class="project-title oswald">LoveCoups</h3>
					<div class="project-summary">
						<p>From 2017 to 2019, I worked as a front end developer at a company called LoveBook. <a href="https://lovecoups.com/" target=”_blank”>LoveCoups.com</a> is LoveBook's sister website that offers personalized, fully customizable printed coupon booklets.</p>
						<p>At the beginning of 2017, LoveCoups lacked a mobile-friendly version of their website. As all customization of this product is done from the site, they could not capitalize on the growing audience of users who primarily browse the internet with mobile devices.</p>
						<p>I was tasked with rebuilding the LoveCoups website based on branding guidelines and mockups provided by the LoveBook graphics team. A mobile-first design was absolutely essential,  as well as an updated, more intuitive interface for all website traffic — mobile, desktop, and tablet.</p>

					<div class="project-summary">
						<p>In the first semester of my Master’s program at the University of Michigan, I was enrolled in <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/courses/501" target="_blank">Contextual Inquiry and Consulting Foundations</a>. I had the opportunity to be a part of a team that worked with an organization affiliated with the university.</p>
						<p>Our client was facing difficulties in managing their current internal file-sharing workflow. Specifically, a file storage system was implemented by the IT staff but was being underutilized by each department within the organization. Our team’s goal was to investigate the areas where breakdowns in usage were occurring and propose potential solutions to address this issue.</p>
