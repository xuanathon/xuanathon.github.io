			<div class="biography">
				<p>I'm Xuan <em>(pronounced like Schwann cells, for all you biology fans out there)</em></p>
				<p>I don't have a formal background in computer science nor design. Instead, I studied psychology for my undergraduate degree because I am passionate about building empathy with others. I think technology is definitely an area in which there could be more of that. So, I decided to pursue a Master's degree studying UX design at the University of Michigan <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/" class="text-link" target="_blank">School of Information</a>.
				<p>I believe that in order to achieve a really great design, we must first take the time to understand the experiences, behaviors, and emotions that drive our users. As a current UX student, I aim to further develop my skills as a designer and coder. I look for opportunities to grow not only as an experience designer, but also as a creative thinker and effective communicator.</p>
